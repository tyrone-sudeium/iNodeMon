Before v1.0:
	- Make AccountController much more robust to bad/missing data
	- Support both monthly and quarterly intervals
	- Adjust status bar text (push lines together by 2 pixels)
	- Pop up message at start to enter username/password
	- 'Start at login' preference
	- Handle bad username/password nicer
	- Factor code more, and test it

Future:
	- day numbers under history graph
	- Show current IP address?
